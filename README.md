Printing Press allows to to quickly apply different latex templates to your documents.
Press automatically converts and organizes your plain text (txt, md, rst) and compiles.
All latex compilation is done in a temporary directory that is cleaned after the pdf is produced
You only left with the main.pdf, just as God intended.

When you are ready to compile just run

```bash

```
The options for each theme are dynamically read from the file `.press/themes/theme_name/variables.tex`.
You can use comments to add variable descriptions.
Currently only supports text and boolean variables.

```tex
\newcommand{\authorname}{Default Name} %Author name
\newcommand{\booktitle}{Default Template Title} %Descrption of title variable
\newif\ifisdraft %Description of Boolean Variable
\newcommand{\subtitle}{Your Bookâ€™s Subtitle} %Book subtitle (if any)
```

You can quickly view the options for your theme my running `press [theme] --help`.
For example the previous `variable.tex` would result in 

```shell
> press book --help

```
